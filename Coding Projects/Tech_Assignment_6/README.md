**Tutorial 1 -**

> What you input into both field is logged into the console. The required makes it so that you must input something. Nothing prints if you submit the form with nothing in the fields when the fields are required. When you add the min and max length if your length of the field doesn't match then it will give you an alert that you need to fix your input. In JS when you try to submit something that isn't in the list then it the function in the tutorial will alert you. Other examples you would use JS for data validation is checking if input in a form is valid and also checking user input if it is formatted correctly.

> In the this challenge, I used two html files connected to two separate javascript files. The javascript contacts the backend python file which handles any data with the database. Each python route checks the data sent confirming it is a string and dict form sending to database. The HTML makes sures each field submitted is required. The Javascript then makes sure the the data sent is in the form of a dictionary. I made ten different routes for different uses so I can collect certain data from the database as well as load the HTML files.
